# 🧠 Machine Learning : From Scratch & With scikit-learn

This repository documents my hands-on journey through machine learning. It includes **custom implementations** of ML models using only `NumPy`, as well as **practical experimentation** using popular libraries like `scikit-learn`.

The goal is to:
- ✅ Learn and implement ML algorithms from scratch
- 🧪 Test them on real datasets
- 🤖 Compare performance with `scikit-learn`
- 📊 Visualize results and understand model behavior
